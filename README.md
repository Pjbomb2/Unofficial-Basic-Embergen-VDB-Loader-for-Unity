# NOT OFFICIAL FROM EMBERGEN; just a utility I made to load them into unity and uploaded in case anyone else finds it useful

</br>
Basic VDB loader to load embergen vdb's into unity, paired with a basic small realtime volume renderer
</br>
To load a single file, just drag it into the object field in the script of the MainCamera component
</br>
To load multiple files to be animated, drag a folder with vdb's in it into the object field
</br>
Press play and it will load and render the files(may take a bit)
</br>
Uses a lot of memory
</br>
Cannot load compressed files
